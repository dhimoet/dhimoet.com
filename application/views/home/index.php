        <p class='title'>My Blog  </p>
        <p class='body'>I used to think that writting a blog is a waste of time. Who would even read it? Then one of my friends answered that question: Me. There were so many cases when I received important, helpful, or valuable information, and I simply forgot everything after a few days, or even a few minutes. By writing a blog, I am hoping that everything that has entered my brain will never be lost. Writing a blog is always easier than writing a note or a diary. Also, looking for old information is always easier when it is stored online. Not only it will benefit me, hopefully other people will also benefit from my blog, without me wasting a single paper.  </p>

      <div id='facebook' class='item_description'>
        <p class='title'>My Facebook  </p>
        <p class='body'>Just like other people, I too have a Facebook account. Facebook helps me stay in touch with my friends and family anywhere they are. I was born and grew up in Indonesia. And I have known a lot of people from different countries since I moved to America in 2004. Because of Facebook, we are able to stay connected. Feel free to send me a message, send me a friend request, or stalk me anytime!  </p>
